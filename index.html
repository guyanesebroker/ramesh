        <h1>Have you ever been cheated by someone who would look into your eyes and lie without remorse?</h1>
        <p><mark>Ramesh Ramsaroop</mark> did that to a grandmother. He did that to me, her son.
            He <mark>stole her money</mark> without a second thought. </p>
    </header>
    <main class="container pt-0">
        <p>I'm telling this story so it won't happen to you. To give voice
            to everyone else who has been scammed by men like him. By Ramesh Ramsaroop, born on 10/09/71. The scoundrel.
        </p>
        <p>We were in need of a broker. He came recommended by an Uncle whom had done work for him previously. My uncle
            also knew Ramesh's father, who was a good man. But his son, Ramesh Ramsaroop was nothing like his father.
        </p>
        <p>Having such a good reference we decided to meet with him. He came with a big smile and great promises. He
            made us feel at ease. And yet, something felt off. Something felt wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had been dealing with him verbally until that nagging feeling kept growing. We decided to start
            documenting
            every interaction we were having with Ramesh Ramsaroop. Ramesh Ramsaroop
            <a class="contrast" data-target="clear-explanation" onClick="toggleModal(event)">
                wouldn't give us a clear explanation
            </a>
            of how he was going to ship our goods. <mark>He kept asking for a downpayment</mark>. He claimed that it had
            to be done
            before the 25th of november, 2021 because all shipments would stop after that date due to Christmas. And
            the prices would rise considerably after that date.
        </p>
        <p>
            And yet, we were hesitant. He would get annoyed, even angry that we did not want to pay him. We wanted
            information.
            When we told him we needed time to think, he said he would talk to my Uncle. For what? He went to ask him
            for a downpayment, behind our backs, when we had told Ramesh Ramsaroop that all dealings need be done
            through us.
        </p>
        <p>
            He told my Uncle the same story he had been telling us, that it needed to be done quickly or else. It was
            the same
            story he had been telling us from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you find yourself in a situation, when you are being pressured to do something that doesn't feel
            right,
            you will find that more frequently than not, <mark>you are being manipulated</mark>. This is a common trait
            among scam
            artists.
            They come with big smiles and great promises. They will glose over details, pressuring you to act quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you find yourself in such a situation, step back and look at what is happening around you.
        </p>
        <p>
            After he had been telling us he needed was a downpayment to start the process, which he got from my Uncle -
            the next day he
            was asking for the full payment. <mark>The thief got a taste and wanted more</mark>. This, was another red
            flag and we should have
            stopped dealing with him. But
            remember, he had come recommended by a family member. We decided to give him the benefit of doubt. Here laid
            my mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point I started to double my efforts into documenting every interaction we had with him. Making sure
            everything was recorded electronically. We asked him every single detail we could. We asked him to give us
            receipts,
            which he failed to do. After receiving the full payment, with a promise that he would not need any more
            cash. He made assurances he would handle absolutely everything, from packing our goods, to shipping. He had
            promised door to door, a
            term
            known in the shipping industry. After all had been said and done, after he received the full payment,
            Ramesh Ramsaroop, <mark>like a typical scammer, started to make excuses.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            He kept promising he would come to pack the goods. After a week of chasing Ramesh Ramsaroop, he finally came
            with
            used boxes. Boxes that were torn. Without any packing materials to ensure the items wouldn't break during
            shipment. He promised that everything would be fine when we could clearly see nothing was safe. We could see
            how
            his eyes looked at the items they were packing, calculating their worth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that night, after having being unresponsive for a week, after finalling getting him to come and do the
            packing
            he had promised, after getting Ramesh Ramsaroop to come with borderline threats, <mark>he wanted another
                payment.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            It was at this moment I knew he had scammed us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I asked for the money back. And like every scammer, he tried to blame me. Ramesh Ramsaroop tried to make me
            feel as if I had
            over-reacted. <mark>Expert manipulators will always play on your emotions</mark>. He had done it at the
            beginning,
            creating
            ficticious deadlines. He was doing it now, trying to make it seem as if we were going to get in trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ramesh Ramsaroop stated that he can not return the money. The shipping company would sue us. He was
            desperate
            to find a way to make me change my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            On December 2nd, 2021 I asked Ramesh Ramsaroop to return the money.
        </p>
        <p>
            After realizing that he had stolen my mother's money, and her brothers, she talked to the owner of Ocean
            air.
            The company Ramesh Ramsaroop had said he had given our money to. The owner said he had heard of a Ramesh
            Ramsaroop
            making enquiries, but <mark>he had not made any payments</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since that date he has made a number of excuses why he can't return the money: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>He blamed the owner at ocean air, stating he didn't know anything</li>
            <li>That we talked to the wrong</li>
            <li>The agents he payed were out of the country</li>
            <li>
            <a class="contrast" data-target="sued" onClick="toggleModal(event)">
                We would get sued by Ocean air
            </a>
            </li>
            <li>That he, Ramesh had Covid and was sick</li>
            <li>Every time, there was a new excuse</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I ran into Ramesh Ramsaroop on the 7th of April, 2022 walking out of a shop near to where I live. He looked
            at
            me as he walked out, keeping his head down. I confronted him and I was shocked how he could lie with such
            ease,
            looking straight at me. It was one lie after the other, <mark>without an ounce of remorse having stolen the
                money
                from two elderly people.</mark>
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope that my mistake serves as a lesson to keep those you love safe from people
            like Ramesh Ramsaroop. It is deceitful people like Ramesh Ramsaroop that utilize a range of tactics to scam
            people out of their earnings. It is a lesson we learned the hard way.
